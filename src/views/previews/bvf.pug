  p One strength of the Andover team this season has been its defense, according to Dinapoli.
  p “Our defense is very effective, and [they’ve done] a very good job of stopping the run as well as the pass,” said DiNapoli.
  p “[We need to take] the game one play at a time. We need to play our game and not let the other team affect us. If we can take care of the small details, the big things will take care of themselves,” said Zach Fitzgerald ’18.
  p According to Fitzgerald, Exeter has a strong rushing presence, meaning that its offense is able to advance the ball by running it up the field.

  p “We need to stop their run game. They’ve got a good running back,” said Fitzgerald.
  p For Codrington and the team’s other Seniors, there is much anticipation to finish their Andover careers with a win and to continue the five-year streak of defeating Exeter, according to Codrington.
  p “This game means everything to me. Nothing else matters. I would like nothing more than to finish my Andover career in the winner’s circle and to make it year five in a row. “I’ll spend all week thinking of this game,” said Codrington.
  p Andover is confident headed into its game away against Exeter.
