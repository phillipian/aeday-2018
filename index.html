Andover leads in rivalry wins 73-52-10 and looks to add to this margin on Saturday.</p><p>Heading into its final game, Andover is confident in its ability to beat Exeter, which currently has a losing record of 1-5 this season, according to Michael Codrington ’18.</p><p>“Our mentality going into Exeter is to crush them. We have no excuse not to… Two years [ago], we were about even teams.

We need to play our game and not let the other team affect us. If we can take care of the small details, the big things will take care of themselves,” said Zach Fitzgerald ’18.</p><p>According to Fitzgerald, Exeter has a strong rushing presence, meaning that its offense is able to advance the ball by running it up the field.</p><p>“We need to stop their run game. They’ve got a good running back,” said Fitzgerald.</p><p>For Codrington and the team’s other Seniors, there is much anticipation to finish their Andover careers with a win and to continue the five-year streak of defeating Exeter, according to Codrington.</p><p>“This game means everything to me. Nothing else matters. I would like nothing more than to finish my Andover career in the winner’s circle and to make it year five in a row. “I’ll spend all week thinking of this game,” said Codrington. </p><p>Andover is confident headed into its game away against Exeter. </p><div class="half-width"> <img src="/dist/images/previews/bvf.trynne.jpg"><p class="credits">T.Rynne / The Phillipian</p><p class="caption">Andover has defeated Exeter for the past five years.</p></div><hr></div><div id="gvfh"><h1>Girls Field Hockey</h1><h4>By Nash Johnson '20</h4><p>After finishing off last year’s regular season with a 2-0 victory against archrival Phillips Exeter Academy, Andover Field Hockey looks to duplicate last season’s triumph this Saturday, according to players on the team.

We are all so pumped to take part in the rivalry and hopefully get the win,” said Welch.</p><p>With a position in the New England Preparatory School Athletic Conference (Nepsac) tournament already secured, Andover will continue to work hard and take advantage of the opportunity to play during this fall’s Andover/Exeter Weekend, according to Head Coach Kate Dolan.</p><p>“We always look forward to taking part in what is such a storied and great rivalry.

With a current record of 6-5-3, Andover expects a competitive edge over Exeter, which currently holds a 1-12-1 record.</p><p>In last year’s matchup, Andover came out on top in a close game, with a final score of 2-1. Though the team will not play in the Nepsac tournament this year, Andover looks to finish off the season with a victory against its rival team. </p><p>“Exeter hasn’t won much this season, so we’re feeling like [the game] is going to be fun, but we’ll stay ready for anything. We’re mostly just looking to play the great soccer we all know we can and have fun [while] doing so,” said Co-Captain Krys Swain ’18.</p><p>After a long season, Andover is excited to show off all its hard work and improvement against Exeter, according to Isabella DiBenedetto ’20. </p><p>“The team and I have been waiting for this game the whole season.

Both teams hold impressive records this season, with Andover standing at 11-2 and Exeter at 10-2.</p><p>After losing to Exeter twice last year, Andover looks for redemption this weekend after adding many talented underclassmen to its roster, according to Brooklyn Wirt ’21.  </p><p>Wirt said, “Exeter is a very strong team, and I know that even though we beat them in the past, we can’t underestimate them. They can definitely pull something out of their hat or change up their line-up to throw us off. I think that we need to be prepared for a long-fought game, but I think that we definitely have the advantage with our record.”</p><p>According to Head Coach Clyfe Beckwith, the game could potentially go either way. The win will depend heavily on crowd noise and the effectiveness of each team’s communication.</p><p>Coach Beckwith said, “[Andover/Exeter] is always unpredictable because the energy is through the roof. First of all, it can go from absolute silence to the point where I can’t communicate with the team. So, depending on what the crowd does, and whether they stay, it can go from really loud to really low.”</p><p>“The difference would be if we can hit our hardest serves in. [That] will make a big difference. If we don’t do that, and play it safe, it’s a different ball game. Andover/Exeter, in my experience, has more often than not gone to five [sets], and if not, it’s a sad event for one team,” added Coach Beckwith.</p><div class="half-width"> <img src="/dist/images/previews/gvvb.mcallahan.jpg"><p class="credits">M.Callahan / The Phillipian</p><p class="caption">Andover Girls Volleyball suffered a loss against Exeter during last year’s Andover/Exeter Weekend.</p></div><hr></div><div id="bvwp"><h1>Boys Water Polo: Championship Preview</h1><h4>by Arnold Su '20</h4><p>With a current record of 11-3, Andover Boys Water Polo enters New England Preparatory School Athletic Council “Liquid Four” Water Polo Championships on Saturday as third seed to play in the semifinal against longtime rival, second seed Phillips Exeter Academy. </p><p>Head Coach Daniel O’Shea said, “Looking ahead, I feel like we are going to certainly be challenged by Exeter, but that we can certainly win against them… If we can execute our plays well and mount a strong defense, then we will be in excellent shape.” </p><p>Exeter has beaten Andover twice this season. According to Coach O’Shea, Exeter’s aggressive defense has proven to be a particularly difficult obstacle for the team. </p><p>“The big challenge is going to be upping our intensity over the next few practices to make sure we are prepared for a very talented Exeter defense,” said Coach O’Shea. </p><p>Andover is using previous losses against the Exeter team as guidance for improvement. According to Co-Captain Nicholas Isenhower ’18, the team has studied Exeter’s style of play and has been able to make adjustments that will hopefully make a difference going forward.</p><p>Isenhower said, “We’ll focus specifically on what Exeter does in looking at our first game. They’re a tough competitor, but having just played them gives us a really good sense of what work needs to be done in the next week.” </p><p>“We have quite a bit of work to do this week in preparation, but we found some very effective strategies in our match last Wednesday,” said Coach O’Shea. </p><p>The team has also been working hard to perfect its general skills, according to Coach O’Shea and Isenhower. </p><p>“We’re working a lot on cleaning up our passing game and protecting the ball under pressure,” said Coach O’Shea. </p><p>“We will work a lot on ball control, absorbing the pressure, six-on-five opportunities, and fine-tuning our skills,” said Isenhower.  </p><p>With an entire season of preparation and work leading up to this game, Andover hopes to take home the championship title. </p><p>Isenhower said, “With this past weekend off, we’re feeling rested and ready to go. We’re excited for our last games of the season this upcoming weekend at Brunswick. We have one goal in sight, and we know we’ve got the talent and determination to execute come game time.” </p><div class="half-width"> <img src="/dist/images/previews/bvwp.rprem.jpg"><p class="credits">R.Prem / The Phillipian</p><p class="caption">Boys Varsity Waterpolo will play Exeter in Interschols this coming Saturday</p></div><hr></div><h4 class="note">Last weekend, Boys and Girls Cross Country raced Exeter.

The trio led the team to a 19-36 victory, bringing Andover’s record to 5-1.</p><p>“I think we did excellent with channeling all the effort and practices in the past few weeks, and we really were strong in our packs. Especially in the Varsity race, there wasn’t much separation between the top runners, and even in the JV race, everyone was really close, and it was really a great team effort,” said Abby Ryan ’21.</p><p>Andover’s top runner, Jones, ran a season-best 18:37 minutes to win the race, followed by MacQueen at 19:18 minutes and Crueger-Cain at 19:22 minutes to round off the top three. Every other Andover Varsity runner also ran a personal best at this race: Isabella Morzano ’18 ran a time of 20:15 minutes to finish fifth, Jess Wang ’18 ran a time of 20:21 minutes to finish eighth, Brooke Sanders ’19 ran a time of 20:34 minutes to finish twelfth, and Posie Millett ’20 completed the race in 20:37 minutes to finish thirteenth.</p><p>One factor that allowed Andover to succeed was the exhausting final sprint carried out over the final 600-meter portion of the race.</p><p>Jess Gearan ’18 said, “I definitely think our strength from the last Exeter race was the last loop of the Great Lawn. There were a lot of people passing Exeter runners.”</p><p>Captain Grace Rademacher ’18 said, “We were courageous, and especially some [Juniors] made some really bold moves on the Lawn. It helped us a lot.”</p><div class="quote"><h1>&quot;We were courageous, and especially some [Juniors] made some really bold moves on the Lawn. It helped us a lot.&quot;</h1><p>GRACE RADEMACHER '18</p></div><p>Smart pacing was another factor that allowed Andover runners to succeed. Utilizing a conservative strategy for the first half of the race, followed by an aggressive second half was particularly effective, according to Crueger-Cain and MacQueen.</p><p>“Before the race, our coaches told us to go out conservatively because everyone’s going to want to sprint at the beginning. At the beginning of the race, a bunch of Exeter runners were in front of Molly and me, and we ended up actually passing them on Heartbreak Hill,” said Crueger-Cain. “[Because] half of our course is downhill… I concentrated on pushing the pace on the downhills and pushing on the uphills. Actually, just pushing everywhere.”</p><p>MacQueen said, “We, for the first mile and a half, stayed right behind Exeter’s first runner, and then, as we got to Heartbreak Hill, we pulled away quite a bit. [We] then stayed away and really just gave it everything on the Great Lawn.” </p><p>Saturday also marked the last home race for Andover’s Senior runners. While saddened by the end of their Andover cross country careers, many runners were motivated to run a memorable final race.</p><p>Jones said, “I think it definitely made me push myself a little harder, just knowing [it was my last race]. Especially on Heartbreak Hill, I was like, ‘This is my last time ever running up Heartbreak, so it’s gotta be good.’ ”</p><p>Andover will shift its focus toward its championship meet, the New England Preparatory School Track Association (Nepsta) D1 Cross Country Championship.</p><p>Rademacher said, “I think that next week — considering that Interschols is just a whole different beast — I think that we’re going to need to really band together. It just helps so much to have good packs at Interschols, as opposed to having one successful person. I think we just need to be calm and confident. We have it in us. I’m not worried.”</p><p>After claiming the runner-up title to Exeter in 2016, Andover will travel to Choate this Saturday in an attempt to reclaim its Nepsta title, last won in 2015 at Taft.</p><div class="half-width"> <img src="/dist/images/previews/GXC.rprem.jpg"><p class="credits">R.Prem / The Phillipian</p><p class="caption">Girls Cross Country will try to win the championship this year after coming in second to Exeter in 2016.</p></div><hr></div><div id="bxc"><h1>Boys Cross Country</h1><h4>By Abby Ryan '21</h4><p>With 200 meters left in the race, Captain Giacomo Marino ’18 surged ahead of the top Phillips Exeter Academy runner to take the lead and secure first place with a time of 15:59 minutes.

It all pays off.”</p><p>“We can only hope to cap off our undefeated season with a championship win on Saturday [at Interschols],” said Tobin.</p><p>Domina added, “We’re in a good position as we approach Interschols, but we take nothing for granted.
