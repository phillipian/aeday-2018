I know [Tuesday] morning at six, the whole team — well, offensive team — is meeting to go over everything, so it’s gonna be really interesting getting up.”</p><p>Although many Andover players are injured, the team remains committed to and supportive of one another, according to Sapienza, who is one of the injured players.</p><p>Sapienza said, “We are just trying to support our teammates that are playing and are in the game and just stay in the game throughout the first match to the last and just motivate our teammates to the best that they can.”</p><p>According to Ricardo Hernandez ’19, the team is motivated to win this game both for the Senior members of the team, as well as for Coach Modeste, who will retire alongside the Class of 2019.</p><p>Hernandez wrote, “Our Captain, Will Litton [’19], always tell us that we don’t get many chances to play football, and knowing this is the last one is hard. We have created such a great community; we’re basically one huge family at this point, and I just wish we had more time to spend together. Though I’m sad, I’m also excited because I know I have to give it my all in order to beat Exeter. We owe it to Coach Mo to send him out with a victory against Exeter, and that’s what I’m aiming to do.”</p><div class="half-width"> <img src="/dist/images/previews/dzhu.ftbl.17.JPG"><p class="credits">D.Zhu / The Phillipian</p><p class="caption">Andover has defeated Exeter for the past six years.</p></div><hr></div><div id="gvfh"><h1>Girls Field Hockey</h1><h4>By Abby Ryan '21</h4><p>Andover Field Hockey is looking to cap off their 14-0 regular season record by beating Phillips Exeter Academy this Saturday.</p><p>According to Anna Bargman ’21, the team has improved over the course of the season and is fine-tuning plays and skills in anticipation for Exeter and the postseason.</p><p>“I think we've definitely improved as a team and we can only go up.

This match holds more meaning for the Seniors on the team, according to Bargman.</p><p>“This Exeter game, since it's home, it's going to be our Senior game, so that's always really fun to honor the seniors, since they're so special to our team. We like to decorate the locker room and the field and make posters for them.

Regardless of any team goals, this is the one we all have had our eyes set on. Even with our team’s losing record, our mindset is ‘Win this one,’” said Stowe.</p><p>In its last week of practice for the season, Andover has been preparing both mentally and physically for Saturday, according to Co-Captain Henry Rogers ’19 and Ethan Hong ’22.</p><p>Rogers wrote in an email to The Phillipian, “We're going to do what we've been doing all week and practice hard.

There would be no point in changing up something huge with the game being so close. We should stick to our game plan we have had all season.”</p><p>One of Andover’s goals is to maintain possession during Saturday’s match up, an aspect of its game it has improved over the course of the season, as well as build off of the offense it has generated in recent games, according to Hong and Rogers.</p><p>Hong wrote, “I think as a team one of our strengths is when we play well, we can keep possession of the ball.

That’s why it’s really upsetting Nacho [Hidalgo ’19] can’t be playing with his recent injury and Phillip [Matteini ’19] is going to be out because of his concussion. It stinks that they can’t be a part of it too, but we are going to be playing for them, and also for the rest of our Seniors. We want them walking off the field taking a last win against the biggest rival on the biggest stage,” said Stowe.</p><p>Rogers wrote, “This game means a lot to the team, as it always does, but means so much to the Seniors on the team.

Every year this is one of the most fun and competitive games we get to play because of the huge rivalry surrounding it. I think this year we have a really strong group of girls who always give 100 percent all the time. If we are training or preparing for a game, the team is always focused and ready to execute the plan.”</p><p>According to Bhathena, over the course of the season, the team has successfully incorporated its new players into the team dynamic.</p><p>“Our team has really improved throughout the season very noticeably. Since we had a lot of new kids this year and three new [Post-Graduates] for leaders, we had to learn how to work together, and I think now we really understand each other. We can play much better together. For the team, our leadership is key. We have two amazing captains, and the three [Post-Graduates] really stepped up to help support them and our team, so that's important too,” said Bhathena.</p><p>According to Karoline Conte ’21 and Bhathena, the team has been long preparing mentally and physically in anticipation for the matchup against Exeter</p><p>“We have a whole week to practice, and I think we are going to work a lot on defense and trying to stop gaps from happening. We don't want Exeter splitting our defense up. We're also going to work on finishing inside the box so we can collect goals,” said Bhathena.</p><p>Conte added, “We have been practicing mindfulness with Andy Housiaux [Currie Family Director of the Tang Institute and Instructor in Philosophy and Religious Studies] a bit. We will maybe review some film this week, similarly to past games, to highlight our strengths and weaknesses. I am very excited for the Exeter game and having the opportunity to play for my team in the oldest high school rivalry in the nation. The team is practicing hard and resting up for the big game.”</p><p>DiBenedetto and Bhathena both cite the home energy and team spirit as critical factors going into the game. The team looks forward to the energy and support from the home crowd and works to harness that in its play.</p><p>Bhathena said, “We have a ton of spirit and I think it really helps our game. During Andover/Exeter, when it's home, I think we're going to have even more spirit from everyone else, including ourselves. I know our bench is always cheering. We don't ever sit on the bench. We are always standing. When we're playing, we're always supporting each other, so that spirit is also for our school and for our team.”</p><div class="quote"><h1>&quot;When we're playing, we're always supporting each other, so that spirit is also for our school and for our team.&quot;</h1><p>Myra Bhathena ’21</p></div><p>DiBenedetto said, “The past few years since I have been on the team, the game has always been tough.

We have really developed as a team. The team goal was to jell, to develop chemistry, so that we could do quick plays, which has happened.”</p><p>“We have a really strong team, and I think our game against Milton helped display the depth we had and the capability of each player to fill in a position no matter what. This season we've been really strong in maintaining the level of intensity and play that we have. I think as the season winds down, we're reconnecting and really pushing ourselves to the next level, which is really awesome.

This year, specifically in the Senior class, there is a lot of experience in the game. That being said, I think we are very well prepared for next weekend.”</p><p>Simpson said, “I would say just the water polo knowledge base for our team this year is way stronger than it has been in the past. Kids have experience and not only have the guys who have been on the team since [Junior] year, Lower year, developed throughout their Andover careers, but that the kids we've brought in this year like Theo [Faugeres ’21], who's played for a long time before, Beckett [McKee ’22] played for a while before. Just bringing these guys who already have so much experience to the game has really just improved our knowledge base of water polo, which is huge in a sport like water polo where experience is kind of essential to succeed.”</p><p>Over the course of the season, Co-Captain Eric Osband ’19, Donchi, and Max Hunger ’20 said they have noticed marked improvement in the team’s defense and communication.</p><p>Osband said, “In terms of just our record, we lost to two teams early that were hard games, and we came back now and we won both of those against the same teams. We've gotten a lot better; the teamwork, fitness, experience… In the beginning of the season, we were really struggling covering our players and being aware of what's going on. I think we're getting a lot better at that as a team, like helping each other out and helping someone else out to steal the ball from the other guys.”</p><p>“We have worked hard all season and everyone has improved a lot. We still really need to improve our communication and movement. Our defense has vastly improved since the start of the season, something that really paid off during the [Phillips Exeter Academy] game. I'm looking forward to playing against a lot of really talented teams and seeing what we can do,” wrote Donchi in an email to The Phillipian.</p><p>Hunger said, “We've just learned how to perfect the basics, and as a team, we've very much improved in communicating and just making sure everyone knows what's going on in the game, what's happening. [We’ve shown] drastic improvement: teams that beat us in the beginning of the year, we beat them. Although they were close games, we were able to win. I say that shows everything there is about the work ethic, the spirit of our team.

If we don't keep the ball protected, if we don't make good passes, smart plays, no single person can stand out without the help from the team, so I think it's going to be more of a team effort than an individual kind of thing,” said Hunger.</p><p>Hunger continued, “I think we're just going to have to get our stuff together and make sure we know how to properly play good water polo because that's going to be a team that challenges the basics and fundamentals of how we play, and I think that's just going to be a game where we're going to have to put everything we have into it.”</p><p>Simpson said, “This is where everyone shows up to play their best water polo, and the four best teams will show up to play each other, everyone's going to bring it. Everyone's going to have their strategies laid-out because all the teams know each other at this point in the season, so really what it comes down to is who's willing to show up, who's willing to have those clutch moments and just close out the season on a high note.”</p><p>If the team defeats Brunswick, it will go on to play in the finals the same day.</p><div class="half-width"> <img src="/dist/images/previews/cwaggoner.wopo.02.JPG"><p class="credits">C.Waggoner / The Phillipian</p><p class="caption">After receiving a bye in the first round, first seed Andover looks to end fourth seed Brunswick’s four-year championship winning streak when the two teams square off in the semi-finals on Saturday</p></div><hr></div><h4 class="note">Last weekend, Boys and Girls Cross Country raced Exeter.
